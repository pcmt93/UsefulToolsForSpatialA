# Useful tools for spatial analysis

This repository will contain some posts with very useful packages and references
for spatial analysis, in R and Python. From basic stuff such as starting from zero to 
use R for spatial analysis, to more advanced techniques in Python/R.

The information posted here is based in my very limited experience using these 
softwares, but I thought that it could be found useful for people. It is actually
useful for me since I always come back to this commands and packages in my 
dayly work.

For now, this is the only post available:

* [Basics for using R for spatial analysis](https://github.com/pcmt93/UsefulToolsForSpatialA/blob/main/intro.md) 



Please feel free to correct any mistakes or type, and of course I more than open 
to any suggestion for improving this repository.
