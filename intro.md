Very useful tools in R/Python for Geospatial Analysis
================

In this document, I will explain some very useful and easy tools that I
use in R for geospatial analysis and for spatial object manipulation
(e.g shapefiles, raster files, spatial databases, etc.). I also going to
present some libraries and commands that I usually use in my-day-to-day
code work for cleaning and dataset manipulation (Stata alike)

For all this I’m going to use mainly examples of public databases from
the Peruvian context (the country that I come from). This is going to be
a very short post, but I’m going to try to include great variety of
tools at least for every basic analysis (e.g open spatial object, modify
them, plot maps, polygons, points, etc.)

## The basics

Open shapefiles:

``` r
  mun <- readOGR(paste0("~/Dropbox/paulo_RA/Narcos/databases/municipios/update"), 
                        "BAS_LIM_DISTRITOS") # rgdal library
```

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "/Users/ptrifu/Dropbox/paulo_RA/Narcos/databases/municipios/update", layer: "BAS_LIM_DISTRITOS"
    ## with 1834 features
    ## It has 18 fields
    ## Integer64 fields read as strings:  Hectares

``` r
  # An easly inspect some objects:
  plot(mun)
```

Of course, we are able not only to open a shp but even a latlong file
and transform it to a GIS kind of object. See for example:

``` r
  enaho <- read.dta13(paste0("~/Dropbox/BDatos/ENAHO/2020/737-Modulo01/",
    "enaho01-2020-100.dta")) # Kind of large dataset around 50k observations
```

    ## Warning in read.dta13(paste0("~/Dropbox/BDatos/ENAHO/2020/737-Modulo01/", : 
    ##   p113a:
    ##   Missing factor labels - no labels assigned.
    ##   Set option generate.factors=T to generate labels.

``` r
  # However we can easly handle this as an spatial object:
  
  coordinates(enaho) <- ~ longitud + latitud

  # A very important thing is to identify coords systm. For usual lat/long 
  # the following works:
  
  proj4string(enaho) <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326") # Here we are defining the coord syst.
    # sp library
  
  plot(enaho) # And we can plot it 
```

Now we have in our R work enviroment two spatial objects, a polygon
object, Peruvian municipalities, and a point object, Peruvian household
for the Annual National Survey (ENAHO). Of course we can print this
together in a graph, but first we need to check if both spatial objects
have the same coords system

``` r
  print(crs(enaho))
```

    ## CRS arguments: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs

``` r
  print(crs(mun)) ## crs from raster library
```

    ## CRS arguments:
    ##  +proj=utm +zone=18 +south +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs

As you may see, the municipality dataset is in UTM coord system
(projected in meters), and the household survey is in standard latlong
coordinates. We can easily transform everything in UTM coords (it is
going to be useful later on) as follow:

``` r
  enaho <- spTransform(enaho, crs(mun))
  
  # And of course we can plot it together in a graph 
  plot(mun) # And we can plot it 
  plot(enaho, add = TRUE, col='red', pch=1, cex = .2) # And we can plot it
```
